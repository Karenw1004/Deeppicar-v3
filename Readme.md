# DeepPicar


DeepPicar is a low-cost autonomous RC car platform using a deep
convolutional neural network (CNN). DeepPicar is a small scale replication
of NVIDIA's real self-driving car called Dave-2, which drove on public
roads using a CNN. DeepPicar uses the same CNN architecture of NVIDIA's
Dave-2 and can drive itself in real-time locally on a Raspberry Pi 3.
